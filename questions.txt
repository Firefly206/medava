Your questions here.

- Why do C/C++ allow omitting the parameter name in main(), but Java does not?

- {As a result, maximumPlaylistSize cannot make reference to any of elements of data normally associated with an instance of the playlist (i.e., a list of songs). 
These elements that are specific to instance of an ADT are known as fields in Java. Can you understand why?} Is it because static methods don't
have associated object or instance, therefore, it does not know which internal data to look at?

- About Late Binding, does it mean "Fields are statically bound" but method does not? Does it mean method is dynamic, and
Java will choose the subclass version at runtime, depending on the actual object?

- Why not use only instance initializers? Why constructors are still needed

- Why we have to do this 
"
public Thrombolytic() {
  super("Thrombolytic");
}"? Is it because Java does not automatically know how to initialize the superclass? Is it work the same way in cpp?

- Why does Java avoid auto-assigning meaningful numbers?

- If Thrombolytic did NOT provide that implementation 
"
@Override
public MedicineSchedule getSchedule() {
    return MedicineSchedule.Uncontrolled;
}
" then does that makes Thrombolytic abstract?

- abstract versus interface
